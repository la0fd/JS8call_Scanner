# JS8call_Scanner
Addon for JS8Call - scanner for 80, 40, 30 and 20 meters. I have devided the hour in 4 x 15 minute intervals, and each interval into 60 slots. I randomly transmit a beacon within one slot in each band. In this way the system could automatically find a suitable band for a JS8 connection, letâ€™s say for emergency communication.
The band hopping had to be standardized, so that all stations would be on the same band at the same time. If we used 6 bands: 160, 80, 60, 40, 30 and 20 meters, the system would be very solid, with 10 minute intervals times 4 time slots. This system requires the use of a broadband antenna and/or an antenna tuner.
I initially used the JS8Call API and some code by Jeff Francis - https://github.com/jfrancis42.
I am a terrible programmer, but maybe someone out there could go through my code and clean it up! I am looking for someone experimenting together.
