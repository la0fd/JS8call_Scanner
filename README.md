# JS8call_Scanner
Addon for JS8Call - scanner for 80, 40, 30 and 20 meters. I have devided the hour in 4 x 15 minute intervals, and each interval into 60 slots. I randomly transmit a beacon within one slot in each band. In this way the system could automatically find a suitable band for a JS8 connection
